## Description

The goal of this project was to put into practice the skills I learned over the first year of studies.

We were tasket with creating a blog site. We could choose the design and topics covered on the blog, but it was to contain at least the following pages:

- Home page
- About page
- List of blog posts
- Blog post specific pages
-	Contact page.

And the following functions:
- Carousel showing the latest posts.
- "View more" button to let you view more than 10 posts.
- Form validation on the contact page.

## Built With
