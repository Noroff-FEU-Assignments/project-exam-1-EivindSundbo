                    <h1>From veggies to meat... <br>And how I started cooking</h1>
                    
                    <p class="desktop-tablet">For 16 years I was a vegetarian. Okay, a pescetarian, but I don’t like to be nitpicky – unlike my fellow dieters. This was in my radical youth – I was a music and drama student in high school and felt bad for all the animals. Who were they hurting? Except other animals of course, and the occasionally careless human. <br><br>My dietary choices caused a lot of headache for the rest of the family. It took about 10 years before my father stopped nagging, and additionally 5 years for my mother. But I stood my ground, stubborn like a bull, and made big business as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-JwcPC-kI&t=2s" target="_blank" class="youtube-link">TV chef</a>. Well, not big business exactly, but business, nevertheless.</p>

                    <p class="desktop-tablet">Then, a life-changing event occurred. I became a father. Suddenly I was tired all the time, exceeding the exhaustion that 16 years of protein deficiency caused. Between juggling baby cries all night long and diaper changes during the day (and sometimes during the night), I had an awakening. Well, not literally, but figuratively. I couldn’t pre-taste the meaty Pasta Bolognese dinner glass before giving it to my baby, and while at risk of serving her burning hot food gruel I made a decision - I had to rejoin the meat community. For my daughter’s sake. Now I’ve got 99 problems, but protein ain’t one. <br><br>16 years out of the game had made my cooking skills rusty, and I embarked on a journey, discovering new foods, new techniques and new flavors. Now, two years later, I am hardly an expert, but want to share my newfound knowledge. Join me in my exploration and help me bring home the bacon.</p>
